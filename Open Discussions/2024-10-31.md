### Native Advertising: 
Omri: brought up with Chrome, bringing it up with Edge as a formality. Looking for support of native advertising, different from video display. Make user browsing experience less intrusive. Use 3P party JS library for iOS and Android to render ads. Common use case is advertising (performance advertisers, sponsors) working to boost engagement metrics with publishers. Have personalizations where we take the position as an editor. Not just doing monetization. 
There are different forms of targeting we do and taking advantage of user intent, buyer websites. Identified working with Chrome team (in/out of WICG) with gaps in retargeting.     

Issac: If you want to spend a little bit of time on each case, if the thing we want to talk about is if we want to support native advertising, where the advertising content is displayed with style. We could discuss the technical limitations.

IF: Are the second and third one related to coordinating multiple auction slots on a page? Is that correct?    

Omri: The same call differentiation between having more auction calls on a page and rank in amount   

IF: The reason you are differentiating multi-slot for native and display is because its more important? I don’t understand the delta   

Omri: From a product POV our advertisers request that we need to honor, same thing with publishers and we need to coordinate those requests. And then there is the platform, if we don’t prevent duplication which is a basic use case, if you got 10 items that will be rendered below the article, rendered via PPA. We could see the same results, which is bad for performance and is bad advertisers.    

IF: In my mind, from an ad sever POV, applies to any of the inventory, I think I understand. Does anyone else have any questions?   

IF: For the look and feel element. I know with the fenced frames Chrome has done the work to enable cases where you can combine info from multiple sites after you surrender network access. So you would not be able to exfiltrate info from sites. So for sellers that want to inject video player, a thought we discussed- if publisher stylings could get into fenced frames, but the thing that became useful after exfiltration, would that enable styling in the world you are used to? MK     

Omri: Similar use case: IAB has safereign (look) when a publisher is setting up google ad manager, there is an API that can get signals that the page size moved, or container increased. Something similar to that on a much more strict basis in order to get what the publisher needs.   

DD: The potential solution, thats the use case that google wants to do for payment processing. So you load in info and seal/lock off fenced frames network access right?       

MK: Yup, this is what we are working on in SafeReign.  its possible for rendering env to mix together things from 2 different sources. Mixing is risky for privacy. You have access to those 2 sources after you give up network access. Thats the general mechanism we have explored so far. Thats what I hope would be a good use case.    

DD: SafeFrame? Omri you said that it allows us without talking directly to the frame, thats another thing that won’t be available in a FencedFrame.    

MK: Yes you can only pass a message directly related to an ad. You would not want both env to be in constant communication because of unwanted messaging.    

Omri: All of the other usage, the usage becomes so vast that only by looking at it what are the required use case. We prepared a list of native advertising concerns, css styles…    

DD: Do you say so many worklets because for #13 each of those is a separate auction?   

Omri: Preparing for the PPA workflow in a few weeks   

IF: Looking through the bullets, I am understanding 1,2,3 to be related through the look and feel, 4, the network call from FencedFrame, where is that?    

Omri: We don’t know its a general concern. Bucket 4,5 as sending beacon outside of FencedFrame. They are valid use cases.    

IF: The document that I am sharing is the master issue. Here are the 3 business use cases and the chat document 1,2,3 would be things that you see required for the first business case.    

IF: Lets focus on the chat (1,2,4) Those three could be handled with the pattern that MK described earlier (publisher packet gets into the FencedFrame)?   

Omri: It does cover what we need    

IF: Are we sharing the same agreement that you may be able to pass a macro into the fencedframe but k-anon will be a requirement, or is that something you guys want to change.    

Omri: I think it will be ok.    

Taal: I wanted to add regarding assets in the FencedFrames. When are they downloaded? The assets are downloaded and stored on Chrome browser.   

IF: For look/feel putting together a proposal with Google would be nice. The auction time download call ultimately as a source, would need to pass k-anonymity.    

MK: To respond to Taal: When we first described PPA and the various proposals of k-anonymity, we were thinking of things that involved downloading the ads in advance but we have alot of difficulties with this- looking into tother ways. We have liked allowing you to load stuff across the networks, which doesn't involve mixing between domains. IF, you broached a different idea, which is to allow url to be influenced from 2 domains and enforce k-anonymity, but we haven't explored it and doesn’t meet ithe privacy bar.  If we separate network loading from ad and publisher and only allow those 2 pieces of info to flow before cutting off network access is the direction we are trying to explore.  

IF: Not attempting to say we could to that. Today we have flexibility we cannot promise in the future, that doesn’t mean we cant put those attributes in a FencedFrame.  

IF: On the look/feel part: We need a more precise proposal. We should decouple resizing from it.    

MK: Infinite scroll is diff from look/feel, it is related to ad coordination and suppression support. Is that correct?    

IF: Lets go into the second major bucket (#2) Ideally you are not showing the same ad multiple times on a page, and you would be able to block it. ScoreAd() doesn’t allow for that auction mechanic, cross ad coordination. The way that this is done today is that in the call to your ad server, the cap is applied and the top 3 ads are the same etc.. Is that the dynamic you are referring to?    

Omri: Yes, its an image, title. When you go into the display we are trying to avoid the same ad being displayed/rendered because it affects financial performance.    

IF: Let me ask- with the ADSAPI model, we have scoreAds() where the idea is that you can apply competitive exclusion, roadblocks etc. Is there an issue you are aware of or should we explore if that is sufficient together?    

Omri: Two cases: The publisher doesn’t want the buyer to include specific text? The buyer doesn’t want something to be shown. Once you block each one we need to ensure that the next in line is regular. So we need to be aware of what is previously blocked.    

MK: I think it is worth exploring, multiple slots being decided in a single path. There is a version that can work wth privacy goals. IF, you mentioned scoreAds(), can we discuss differences between scoreAds() and scoreAd(), is there a difference in the auctions- because it is still producing a single winner?  Omri wants a stream of winners, not a single winner. Can ad #50 be influenced by ad #1? Having multiple winners from an auction seems fine if they are rendered through FencedFrames   

IF: 1. Yes, scoreAds() can result in multiple winners and auctions. 2. Stream is misleading, we should consider infinite scrolling separately.  Given multiple slots on the page, the idea is to support that in a protected auction, generatebids() returns a url and it should still be the url from scoreAds() but the buyer has more of an opportunity to say “hey I shouldn’t submit this 3 times” Either we can solve with the current code, or with a miss we can solve at it.    

Taal: If we would like to have multiple outputs we would need more than url, we would need the winning bid. Today we return a urn and I am not sure if it will be enough if we have 10 results and need to know how good they are (bid pricing) it becomes more complex.    

MK: The PPA way of handling what your issue is. The reason you want to know the value of things coming out of the auction is because you want to inverweve those stuff with contextual stuff and want to know what is best. The PPA way: you can pass in conditionalBids and take the 100 contextual things along with their values and put it into the auction. Would that take care of what you are thinking?    

Taal: We looked into this, we don’t have enough time to discuss this. additonalBid is important to bring context to the auction but it isn’t enough because of (#6, #7)    

IF: Omri I am really sorry, need to drop. We have a path for ⅔ of bucket 1 (look/feel) We (MK) should push forward on a rough design to answer questions. Resizing we should decouple. For auction stuff, the slight differences between ADSAPI an PPA is useful. We should start off next time with this.
