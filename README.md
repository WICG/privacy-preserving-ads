This is the repository for various privacy-preserving ads proposals.

# Ad Selection API Proposal
## Overview
The documents in this repository are meant to help describe the Ad Selection API, a privacy-preserving ads (PPA) proposal that is substantially similar to other ad serving proposals from a structure, flow, and syntax perspective, but with some core differences related to overall model and infrastructure that we believe provide critical capabilities that will enable the open web ecosystem to effectively move to privacy-preserving ads APIs.

We plan to hold regular meetings under the auspices of the WICG to go through the details of this proposal and quickly respond to feedback. Please comment on the timing question in [Issue #50](https://github.com/WICG/privacy-preserving-ads/issues/50) if you want to participate in these meetings to influence the direction of the proposal.

If you are ready to dive in, we recommend you start with the following content:
- The [**Ad Selection API overview**](Ad%20Selection%20Overview.md), which describes the proposal at a high-level including descriptions of privacy model, infrastructure, and features.
- The [**Auction & infrastructure design**](Auction%20&%20Infrastructure%20Design.md), which contains diagrams of the auction and ad serving flows and how they are similar and different to other proposals in this space.

Since this API leverages similar concepts from other proposals, some of the concepts referenced are already well-described in those proposals' GitHub repositories. We aim to minimize duplicative explanations and definitions in favor of focusing on documenting key additions and differences.
